# Leetcode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. These solutions are automatically synced to this repository using **LeetSync**, which streamlines the process of keeping my LeetCode progress updated on GitHub.

## Features

- **Automatic Sync**: Solutions are automatically uploaded to this repository each time a problem is solved on LeetCode.
- **Languages Used**: I primarily use [Your Preferred Language(s)] (e.g., Python, Java, C++) to solve the problems.
- **LeetSync Integration**: Utilizes [LeetSync](https://github.com/duncan-muir/LeetSync), a tool that syncs LeetCode submissions with GitHub, ensuring that my progress is continuously tracked.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```plaintext
Leetcode/
│
├── ProblemName_ProblemID/
│   ├── SolutionFile.ext
│   └── README.md (Problem description and approach)
├── ProblemName_ProblemID/
│   ├── SolutionFile.ext
│   └── README.md
│
└── ...
```

Each folder contains:
- **SolutionFile.ext**: The actual code file containing the solution to the LeetCode problem.
- **README.md**: A brief explanation of the problem, my approach, and any relevant notes or alternative solutions.

## How to Use

If you'd like to explore my solutions or contribute:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode.git
   ```
2. Browse through the problems and their corresponding solutions in each folder.
